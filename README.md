# Spark-Notebooks for clustering with Spark

We use three different clustering algorithms on Spark, adapting the K-Means, CAST and DBSCAN approaches.
These algorithms have been applied to three datasets: Acute Inflammations UCI dataset, 1000 Genomes, and the DDD cohort.

As Scala Spark code can be very dense, complete documentation is often needed to grasp its content. The Notebook format was chosen for the presence of markups which facilitate the insertion and typesetting of such documentation, as well as the possibility to execute bits of code independently for testing.

This repository thus contains the notebooks corresponding to the application of each algorithm to these datasets, using different representations.
